### Credentials file

<!-- TODO: Document `path` and `privs`  -->
| Parameter  | Type   | Description               |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `realm`    | string | Authentication Realm      |
| `username` | string | User name                 |
| `password` | string | User password             |
| `otp`      | string | One-time password for 2FA |

### Template VM configuration

The template must be a bootable VM with enabled DHCP and QEMU guest agent installed. See [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Qemu-guest-agent) for more details.

### Proxmox configuration

You **MUST** create a **DEDICATED** user, pool and storage for usage with this plugin. Any other configuration is untested and unsupported.

After creating a **DEDICATED** user, pool and storage follow procedure below to add required permissions:

1. Add template VM as a member to the pool.
2. Add storage as a member to the pool.
3. Add following roles for the user to the pool:
   * `PVEVMAdmin`,
   * `PVEPoolUser`,
   * `PVEDatastoreUser`.
4. Add following role for the user to the network that you will use for deployed VMs:
    * `PVESDNAdmin`.
5. Add following role for the user to the node with the storage, network, template etc.:
    * `PVEAuditor` without propagation.

## Development

### Integration tests

1. Create and fill out `credentials.json` file in project root (see [Credentials file](#credentials-file) for details)
    ```bash
    cp credentials.example.json credentials.json
    ```
2. Create and fill out `config.json` file in project root (see [Plugin settings](#plugin-settings) for details)
    ```bash
    cp config.example.json config.json
